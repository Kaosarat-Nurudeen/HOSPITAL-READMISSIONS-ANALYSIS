# HOSPITAL-READMISSIONS-ANALYSIS
This project aims to analyze patient data to identify key factors contributing to hospital readmission within a 30-day period. By examining various patient demographics, clinical measurements, and hospital stay metrics, the goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help a hospital reduce its readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.
